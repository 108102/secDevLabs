## What is NoSQL Injection?



## Setup

To execute this application, you need of 2 tools on your machine:
1. Docker
2. docker-compose

And to up the application, simply run these commands:

```sh

cd secDevLabs/owasp-top10-2017-apps/a1/mongection

```

```sh

make install

```

Then simply visit [http://localhost:9995][App] ! ðŸ˜†

## How Works

The application simulate a simple Register/Login page. When you can register a account and when you do a successful login, you email will be showed on page.

## The Application

When you visit the homepage of application (http://localhost:9995) a page containing 2 buttons are showed: 1 to do Login (http://localhost:9995/login) and 1 to Register a new account (http://localhost:9995/register).ðŸ˜œ

## Exploiting

So, to exploit this application, you must to send a NoSQL query on email and password fields, such as: {"$ne":""}. This query tells to MongoDB that must return all results that are different of " " (null, empty).

You can do this via curl and only can be exploited with this tool :p, simply make a request containing the NoSQL query on email and passwords fields to login endpoint:

```sh
curl -X 'POST' 'http://localhost:9995/login' -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"email": {"$ne":""}, "password": {"$ne":""}}'
```

The application will return the first user that MongoDB find, and you'll see a message containing "Hello user".
