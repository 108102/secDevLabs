# Attack Narrative - Cimentech
The main goal of this document is to describe how a malicious user could exploit a vulnerability, intentionally installed on Cimentech from secDevLabs, to obtain a remote code execution.

If you don't know [secDevLabs] or this [intended vulnerable web application][2] yet, you should check them before reading this narrative.

It's possible to reach the server's web application from the standard HTTP port 80, as shown by the image below:

Afterwards, by having a look at the `/robots.txt` file, it's possible to find the `CHANGELOG.txt` file in the `Disallow` field, as depicted by the image below:

When accessed, an indication of the version of the Content Management System (Drupal) can be found, as show below:

Having the CMS version, it's possible to check on [exploit-db][3] if there are any exploits associated to that version, in this case, Drupal 7.57. The results of the search are depicted on the image below:

By using [searchsploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/searchsploit) tool, an attacker could also find this same result via terminal. To install it, simply type the following in your OSX terminal:

```sh
brew install exploitdb
```

Then simply search for the version of the CMS found:

```sh
searchsploit drupal 7.
```

Running the malicious Ruby code, we have evidence that a remote code execution is possible on the web server, using the following commands as shown below:

```sh
ruby 44449.rb http://localhost
```

Following on the last step, a shell is created by the malicious code on which we can execute commands, just like `whoami`, as shown by the image:
