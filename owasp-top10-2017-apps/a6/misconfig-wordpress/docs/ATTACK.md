# Attack Narrative - SecWeb: A Vulnerable WordPress Site

The main goal of this documentation is to describe how a malicious user could exploit multiple Security Misconfiguration vulnerabilities intentionally installed on SecWeb, a vulnerable wordpress site, from secDevLabs.

If you don't know [secDevLabs](https://github.com/globocom/secDevLabs) or this [intended vulnerable web application](https://github.com/globocom/secDevLabs/tree/master/owasp-top10-2017-apps/a6/misconfig-wordpress) yet, you should check them before reading this narrative.

----

### Note: This narrative shows a few examples of security vulnerabilities found in this app, although there could be more. üßê

## üëÄ

It's possible to reach the site through the HTTP port 8000, as shown by the image below:

</p>

Having a closer look at what's written bellow `SECWEB` we have a sign that the site might be using the WordPress CMS. We can confirm that suspicion by trying to access the `/wp-admin` page. As we can see from the image below, our suspicion is confirmed:

 <p align="center">
    <img src="attack1.png"/>
</p>

An attacker could try to log in with the username: `admin` and realize, through the error message, that `admin` is a valid user, as depicted by the image below:

 <p align="center">
    <img src="attack2.png"/>
</p>

## üî•

At this moment, an attacker could use [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) to perform a brute force attack using this [wordlist] (if you need any help setting up your proxy you should check this [guide](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1783066-configuring-firefox-to-work-with-burp)). To do so, after finding the login POST request, right click and send to Intruder, as shown bellow:

 <p align="center">
    <img src="attack10.png"/>
</p>

In `Positions` tab, all fields must be cleared first via `Clear ¬ß` button. To set `pwd` to change acording to each password from our dictionary wordlist, simply click on `Add ¬ß` button after selecting it:

 <p align="center">
    <img src="attack11.png"/>
</p>

If a valid password is found, the application may process new cookies and eventually redirect the flow to other pages. To guarantee that the brute force attack follows this behavior, set `Always` into `Follow Redirections` options in `Options` tab, as shown bellow:

<p align="center">
    <img src="attack13.png"/>
</p>

In `Payloads` tab, simply choose the wordlist from `Load...` option and then the attack may be performed via `Start attack` button:

 <p align="center">
    <img src="attack12.png"/>
</p>



After sending at around 200 requests to try and obtain a valid admin password, it is possible to see from the image below that the app redirected us when the password `password` was used, thus giving us evidence that it might be the `admin` password.

</p>

The suspicion was confirmed when trying to log in with these credentials. As shown below:

## üëÄ

Now that we know we're dealing with a WordPress, we can use the [WPScan] tool to perform a sweep in the app in search for known vulnerabilities. The following command can be used to install it:

```sh
brew install wpscan
```

And then use this command to start a new simple scan:

```sh
wpscan -u localhost:8000
```

    <img src="attack4.png"/>
</p>

## üî•

As seen from the image above, the tool found out that the CMS version is outdated and vulnerable to an Authenticated Arbitrary File Deletion. By using [searchsploit] tool an attacker could find a [malicious code] to exploit this vulnerability.

To install this tool, simply type the following in your OSX terminal:

```sh
brew install exploitdb
```

Then simply search for the version of the CMS found:

```sh
searchsploit wordpress 4.9.6
```
 <p align="center">
    <img src="attack5.png"/>
</p>

## üëÄ

By having another look at the results from [WPScan], it's possible to see that the tool found a browseable directory in the app: `/wp-content/uploads/`, as we can see from the image below:

 <p align="center">
    <img src="attack6.png"/>
</p>

## üî•

We can confirm that the directory is browseable by accessing it through a web browser, as shown by the following image:

 <p align="center">
    <img src="attack7.png"/>
</p>

----

## üëÄ

Using [Nikto] tool to perform a security check scan, it's possible to see that there are multiple points of attention regarging security headers.

To install it, you can use the following command in your OSX terminal:

```sh
brew install nikto
```

Then scan the web app using:

```sh
nikto -h http://localhost:8000/
```

 <p align="center">
    <img src="attack8.png"/>
</p>

Now, by doing the following curl command to check the HTTP headers of the application, we can confirm that it indeed exposes the PHP version installed, as shown by the image below:
