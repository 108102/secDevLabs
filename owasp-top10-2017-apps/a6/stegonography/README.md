# Stegonography

</p>

Stegonography is a Node.js web application that uses an API and a simple front end to simulate a real steganography application. It is built with two main routes, it's home( `/` ) and (`/login`), where the admin can log in to make changes to the page.

## What is Security Misconfiguration?

Security misconfiguration can happen at any level of an application stack, including the network services, platform, web server, application server, database, frameworks, custom code, and pre-installed virtual machines, containers, or storage. Automated scanners are useful for detecting misconfigurations, use of default accounts or configurations, unnecessary services, legacy options, etc.

The main goal of this app is to discuss how **Security Misconfiguration** vulnerabilities can be exploited and to encourage developers to send secDevLabs Pull Requests on how they would mitigate these flaws.

## Setup

To start this intentionally **insecure application**, you will need [Docker][Docker Install] and [Docker Compose][Docker Compose Install]. After forking [secDevLabs](https://github.com/globocom/secDevLabs), you must type the following commands to start:

```sh
cd secDevLabs/owasp-top10-2017-apps/a6/stegonography
```

```sh
make install
```

Then simply visit [localhost:10006][App] ! üòÜ

## Get to know the app ü¶ï

To properly understand how this application works, you can follow these simple steps:

- Hide a message into an image.
- Decrypt the message from this image.
- Try using a password to better protect your image!

## Attack narrative

Now that you know the purpose of this app, what could possibly go wrong? The following section describes how an attacker could identify and eventually find sensitive information about the app or it's users. We encourage you to follow these steps and try to reproduce them on your own to better understand the attack vector! üòú

### Vulnerabilities identification  üëÄ

#### Verbose error stack traces are output to end users

An attacker, when trying to enumerate available pages on the application, could come across a verbose error stack trace with potentially sensitive information that could compromise the app. An example of a verbose error stack trace is as shown by the image bellow:

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/stack_trace.png"/>
</p>

#### Default username and passwords are being used

Using [Dirb] with it's default wordlist, `common.txt`, to enumerate existing pages on the application and hide the "Not Found" with the `-N 401` flag, it's possible to find what seems to be a login page, as pointed in the image bellow:

```sh
dirb http://localhost:10006 -N 401
```

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/dirb_result.png"/>
</p>

By visiting `http://localhost:10006/login` we get to the following screen:

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/login_page.png"/>
</p>

A quick `admin:admin` guess revealed that we can successfully log in to the application and get to the admin's control-panel, as shown by the image bellow:

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/admin_page.png"/>
</p>

#### Verbose session token gives away unnecessary information

After logging in to the application, it's possible to see it sets a session token: `jwtSessionToken`. As shown by the following image:

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/jwt_token.png"/>
</p>

Even though using verbose tokens might not pose a straight forward security vulnerability, on certain apps it might give away the hint an attacker needs to compromise it's security. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç

## Secure this app üîß

How would you migitate this vulnerability? After your changes, an attacker should not be able to:

* See error stack traces
* Log in with default credentials
* See verbose token names
