## How to use Dirb üë®‚Äçüíª

For this course, we are providing you with a wordlist of common URL directories, which can be found [here][1], to be used with Dirb. Feel free to use your own though üòâ !

To use Dirb, we need an URL and a wordlist. What the tool does now is try to access each and every URL directory present in the wordlist to see which ones are available. Be sure to only use Dirb with SecDevLabs machines and for educational purposes.

An example on how to use it would be as follows:

```sh
$ dirb http://localhost:5000 ./docs/common.txt
```
