## So... I built this app, it looks great, but how can I send it to SecDevLabs?

Well, a good place to start is to make sure you can deploy your app with Docker-Compose. All the apps in SecDevLabs are built with it in order to ensure you can get get right into the action! ‚úì

So your app can be deployed with Docker-Compose, nice job! But wait, does it have a Makefile? If it doesn't, be sure to have a look [here][1], we have a template you can follow to create your own! ‚úì

## Ok, my app is looking awesome and all set up with Docker-Compose, what else do I need to send it?

Do you have an attack narrative? Well, if you don't, worry not, we got you! Have a look at this [attack narrative template][2] and you will be able to write your own in no time! ‚úì

Just be sure to add some pictures! A picture is worth a thousand words! üëç

## I think I know how to solve a vulnerability, but how can I send my solution to SecDevLabs?

Nice! You can send us your mitigation of the vulnerability directly through a Pull Request, using the [review requested üëÄ][3] label.

We expect your mitigation proposal to have all the changes needed to completely fix the vulnerability and a short explanation on what you are doing. If you're feeling a bit lost, try having a look at [this mitigation solution][4], it might help!

## I've found an error on one of the apps!

Please let us know! Send a Pull Request with the `bug üï∑ ` label!
