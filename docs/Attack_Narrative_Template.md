# Attack Narrative - The Template
The main goal of this document is to describe how a malicious user could exploit a vulnerability, intentionally installed on `your app's name` from secDevLabs, to `add here the vulnerability`.

If you don't know [secDevLabs] or this `intended vulnerable web application` (be sure to leave a link here!) yet, you should check them before reading this narrative.

This first part should be about how the vulnerability was found, you should explain all the steps needed for someone to be able to replicate this vulnerability.

Usually, some nice steps to include are:
* What's the app main page? How can you access it?
* How did you discover the vulnerability? If you used the command line, be sure to include the command used! You can include the command by doing this:
```sh
    ```sh
    $ My awesome command here

    ```
```

Add as many images as you can! A picture is worth more than a thousand words!

To add an image, simply add this code:
```
<p align="center">
    <img src="yourimage.png"/>
</p>
```

Now that we know how an attacker could go from the app's main page to the vulnerability, it's time to exploit it!

In this section, your goal should be on how to exploit the app and it's steps. A good guideline to follow is:
* Include all the steps to reproduce the exploit.
* If you used the command line, be sure to add the command here!
* If you use an external exploit, such as those found in [ExploitDB], be sure to include the link to it and how you were able to find it!

And as always, images!!! ðŸ˜ƒ
